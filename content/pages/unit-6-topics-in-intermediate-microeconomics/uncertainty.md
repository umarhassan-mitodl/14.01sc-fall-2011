Up until now, our analysis of consumers and firms alike has assumed that both have perfect knowledge of the future. However, the world is filled with uncertainty. We don't know if it will rain tomorrow, if the stock market will go up next year, or if a new business will succeed or fail. This lecture analyzes the implications of uncertainty for consumer decisions.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} Some individuals, when facing a lottery or other situation of uncertainty, prefer not to accept gambles that are better than fair (i.e., have a positive expected return), because of the negative utility they receive from uncertainty. What is the name for this behavior? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Expected utility theory.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Risk aversion.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Risk loving.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Risk neutrality.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is risk aversion. A risk averse individual will not enter into even gambles with positive expected value because she or he receives negative utility from uncertainty; in fact, a risk averse individual will pay to avoid gambles.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} A person who is risk-loving by definition has a utility function with what shape? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Any of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Concave.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Convex.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Linear.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}A person who is risk-loving has a utility function that is convex. A person who is risk-neutral has linear utility, and a person who is risk-averse has a utility function that is concave.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} In general, what is true of people's risk aversion for changes in income that are marginal (i.e., very small changes in income)? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It depends on the shape of the individual utility function.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Their risk aversion does not change.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}They are less risk averse.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}They are more risk averse.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}In general, people are less risk averse for very small changes in their income. They may experience some disutility from the uncertainty of potentially losing a dollar, but not much. Accordingly, they are more willing to accept a bet with the possibility of a loss for a very small amount of money.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} If a person is risk averse, he will pay a price for insurance even if the expected value of the insurance is lower than the price. Assume that the price of insurance is p, and the expected value (i.e., the expected payouts under the policy) is v. What is the term for the quantity p-v? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Coefficient of relative risk aversion.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Expected utility.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Risk premium.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Risk-loving.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is risk premium. Risk-averse people will buy insurance, because they are willing to pay money to avoid even the possibility of realizing an extremely low level of insurance. This extra money paid for insurance is known as the risk premium.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
