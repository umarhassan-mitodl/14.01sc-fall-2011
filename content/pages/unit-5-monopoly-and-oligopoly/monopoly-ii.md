The analytical picture of monopolies presented in our last lecture may be too simple. Monopolies may not always charge the same price to every customer – they can choose to charge different prices, a phenomenon known as price discrimination. Monopolies are regulated by governments to limit their market power, yet in some cases governments may encourage the operation of monopolies. These cases are discussed in greater detail in this lecture.

## Check Yourself

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

Question 1

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}}Which of the following descriptions corresponds to a natural monopoly? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A firm for which average cost is declining everywhere in the relevant range.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A firm that can produce at lower average cost than any other firm for all relevant quantities.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A firm with extremely large fixed costs and tiny marginal costs.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}All of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}These descriptions are synonymous and all describe a firm that is likely to be a natural monopoly: firms such as utilities or large extraction industries in which the fixed costs far outweigh the marginal costs.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 2

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}}What is an example of a firm using signals from consumers to gauge their willingness to pay and thus price discrimination? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Firms choosing to advertise in particular magazines.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Firms choosing to be more capital-intensive or more labor-intensive.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Firms offering a discount for senior citizens or students.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Firms setting price equal to marginal cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}Given that senior citizens and students generally have lower disposable income, firms can offer them a discount and thus induce them to purchase a product without losing revenue on higher-income customers (who still pay full price). Firms set price equal to marginal cost if they operate in a competitive market, and will choose to be more capital- or labor-intensive based on the ratio of input prices. Advertising decisions are also irrelevant to price discrimination.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 3

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}}What is the potential advantage of a patent system? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It drives the price of the good produced to the competitive market equilibrium.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It eliminates a monopoly.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}It encourages innovation.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It raises the level of output of the good.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is that a patent system encourages innovation, by increasing the profits available in the development of a new product. It does not drive the price to the competitive equilibrium, raise the level of output, or eliminate a monopoly. Instead, patent protection creates an artificial monopoly for the life of the patent.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 4

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}}What is the main challenge in implementing a regulatory system that caps the monopoly price at the competitive market price? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Firms may cheat.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}It is challenging to accurately estimate what the competitive market price is.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Some sales are not observed.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The monopoly will resist the imposition of any price control.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is that it is challenging to accurately estimate what the competitive market price is. This would require accurately estimating the shape of both the supply and demand curves. The other problems mentioned may also be factors, but they are generally less important.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
