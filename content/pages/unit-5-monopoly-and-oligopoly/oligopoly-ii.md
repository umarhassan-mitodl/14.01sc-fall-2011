So far, we have only analyzed one type of oligopoly. However, even when there are a small number of firms in a market, they can behave in a variety of different ways. We can compare the outcomes from these different types of competition to the competitive market. In this lecture, we learn more about different models of oligopoly.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} How does the non-cooperative Cournot equilibrium in an oligopoly compare to the equilibrium in a competitive market? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It depends on the shape of the demand curve.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Less output, less profits.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Less output, more profits.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}More output, more profits.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is that the non-cooperative Cournot equilibrium results in less output and more profits compared to the competitive equilibrium. Each firm in Cournot equilibrium has some market power, which it exploits to raise profits by lowering the amount of production (and thus raising prices).{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} As the number of firms in a Cournot equilibrium increases, what happens to the mark-up charged by each firm? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It becomes equal to zero.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}It decreases.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It increases.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It remains the same.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is that the mark-up charged by each firm in a Cournot equilibrium decreases as the number of firms becomes larger. However, the mark-up will only be equal to zero if the market is perfectly competitive.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} In a perfectly competitive market, the price of a good is equal to the marginal cost of producing it. This is also true in another market structure; which one? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Bertrand competition in an oligopoly.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Competition on quantity in an oligopoly.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Cournot competition in an oligopoly.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Monopoly.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is Bertrand competition in an oligopoly, or competition on price. Cournot competition is equivalent to competition on quantity, and it does not result in a price set equal to marginal cost. In a monopoly, marginal revenue is set equal to marginal cost.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} What is a strategy firms can use to avoid Bertrand competition? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Differentiate their product.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Lower the price of their product.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Produce more of their product.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Raise the price of their product.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is that firms can differentiate their product to avoid Bertrand competition, thus enabling them to set a price that is above marginal cost. Shifting the price does not alter the competitive structure: the firm will still ultimately be required to set the price at marginal cost to remain in the market. In Bertrand competition, it is assumed that firms produce whatever quantity of the good is demanded by consumers, so producing more of the product is not an available option.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
