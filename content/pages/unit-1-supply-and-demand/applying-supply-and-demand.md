You may not realize it, but every time you purchase something, you are participating in a market for that good. Some people supply it, and some people—you!—demand it. In this lecture, we will examine how to analyze supply and demand curves and the impact changes in market conditions and government policy can have on market equilibrium.

Further Study
-------------

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} What determines the price and quantity of a good in a perfectly competitive market? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The government.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The intersection of the supply and the demand curve.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The position of the demand curve.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The presence or absence of substitute goods.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}In a perfectly competitive market, the equilibrium price and quantity sold is given by the intersection of the supply and demand curves. The position of the demand curve and the presence or absence of substitute goods are also relevant, but these answers are incomplete.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} Assume that people enjoy eating either apples or oranges. What happens in the market for oranges when the price of apples goes up? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The demand curve shifts left.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The demand curve shifts right.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The supply curve shifts left.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}There is no change in the demand curve.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}When the price of apples increases, more people will eat oranges because they are more affordable. This causes the demand curve to shift right: at any given price point, people will consume more oranges.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} Now, assume there is a frost in Florida that destroys part of the orange crop. What happens to the market for oranges in this case? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The demand curve shifts right.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The supply curve shifts down.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The supply curve shifts up.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}There is no shift in the demand or supply curves.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}When part of the orange crop is destroyed, there are less oranges available at any price; the supply curve shifts left to a new equilibrium with lower quantity and higher price. An alternative way to conceptualize the change is that the cost of growing fruit, per orange sold, has now increased for the farmers; they are still paying to run their farm, but are selling fewer oranges. For each orange they now sell, they need to charge more.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} The government imposes a minimum wage for workers. Which of the following phenomena is NOT a consequence of this policy change? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}A decline in the average wage paid.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Decreased demand for labor by employers.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Increased supply of labor by workers.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Unemployment.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The minimum wage leads to an increase, not a decline, in the average wage paid. At the same time, however, it leads to an increased supply of labor by workers and a decreased demand by employers, which results in unemployment.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 5
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ5" >}} What is a potential cost of disequilibrium in a market? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}All of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Cost of determining allocation for goods that are highly demanded.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Cost of waiting for people queuing for a good that is in demand.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Efficiency loss (trades that don't get made).{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Market disequilibrium introduces a variety of costs. First, there may be efficiency loss when trades don't get made (e.g., consumer is willing to buy gas at below the minimum price, and a supplier is willing to sell gas at that price, but no sale occurs.) Second, it may be costly for the gas supplier to decide who should receive gas when demand exceeds supply. Third, people may waste time waiting for gas that they could productively use working. However, government interventions that decrease efficiency may also increase equity. This will be discussed more in later lectures.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
