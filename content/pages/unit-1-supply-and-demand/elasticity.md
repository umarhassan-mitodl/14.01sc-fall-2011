Everyone knows the unpleasant feeling that results from the price of something you've been longing to buy increasing – or the excitement of seeing your favorite snack go on sale! When the price of a good changes, consumers' demand for that good changes. We can understand these changes by graphing supply and demand curves and analyzing their properties.

## Further Study

Question 1

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}}Which of the following accurately characterize perfectly inelastic demand? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Demand does not change regardless of what happens to price.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The demand curve is horizontal.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The demand curve is vertical but does not change regardless of what happens to price.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The demand curve is vertical.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}A vertical demand curve means that if the supply curve shifts, only the price changes; there is no change in quantity demanded.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 2

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}}When do we expect to see a perfectly elastic demand curve? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}When a good has a perfect substitute.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}When a good has many complements.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}When a good has no substitutes.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}When there is limited supply of a good.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}When a good has a perfect substitute (for example, hamburgers at different fast food chains), then if there is a price increase at one store, consumers will simply switch to purchasing from another store. This results in a perfectly elastic demand curve. A good that has no substitutes will have perfectly inelastic demand. The existence of complementary goods and the nature of the supply curve do not affect the elasticity of demand.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 3

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}}Lets say a researcher makes a study of patients in hospitals and finds they are much sicker than the average person in the population. Then he concludes that hospitals make patients sick. The researcher is mixing up two concepts; what are they? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Correlation and causation.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Demand and supply.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Shifts along the demand curve and shifts in the demand curve.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Theory and empirics.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}Being in the hospital is correlated with being ill, because primarily ill patients are admitted to the hospital, but this is not the cause of the illness. The primary challenge of empirical economics is to distinguish correlation and causation.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 4

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}}If the elasticity of demand for a good is sufficiently negative, firms may actually lose revenues when they raise the price of the good. Why is this? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Consumers substitute from other goods to buy this firms good.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Fewer people buy the good at the higher price, and so overall revenues are lower.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The elasticity of demand changes.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The supply curve shifts in.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}The elasticity of demand does not change when price changes, and we have not discussed any change on the supply side. If revenue is declining that means that consumers are shifting away from this firms good (now that is newly expensive) and purchasing goods made by other firms, not vice versa.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 5

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ5" >}}What is an example of a supply shock in the orange market that would enable us to estimate demand elasticity? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A new government tax on orange growers.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A plant disease that hits orange crops.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}All of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}An early frost in Florida that destroys crops.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}Any shock to the supply of a good caused by weather or government policy will shift the supply curve, and this will allow us to use the resulting changes in price and quantity sold to estimate the elasticity of demand.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
