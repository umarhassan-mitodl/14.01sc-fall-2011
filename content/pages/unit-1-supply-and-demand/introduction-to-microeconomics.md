Economics may have a reputation as a dismal science, but in fact it addresses some of the most fundamental problems we face: How to make the best decision given that resources are limited. You can use the tools of microeconomics to decide how best to spend your income; how best to divide your time among leisure activities; or how many people to hire in the business you run. Life is full of choices. Microeconomics can help you decide how to make them.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} Which of the following is an accurate description of the primary theme of microeconomics? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A set of constrained optimization problems.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}All of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Analyzing tradeoffs.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Studying how individuals and firms make themselves as well off as possible given conditions of scarcity.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}All three of these answers encapsulate the main theme of microeconomics in a different way: constrained optimization problems allow us to analyze how individuals and firms can make themselves as well off as possible given scarcity. This entails analyzing the trade-offs between investing in different activities.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} What is a model? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A description of an economic phenomenon that makes no extra assumptions.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A full description of a particular economic phenomenon.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}An empirical study that analyzes how a certain part of the economy works.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Any description of the relationship between two or more economic variables.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Models do not provide a complete description of a particular economic phenomenon; instead, they make simplifying assumptions that render the model more tractable to work with. While empirical studies may make use of models, they are not identical.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} What is the key assumption in microeconomics? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Firms maximize profits.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Firms maximize sales.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Individuals maximize their income.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Individuals maximize utility and firms maximize profits.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Though it is accurate to say that firms maximize profits, it is incomplete. Individuals dont solely maximize income, rather utility, and sales and profits for a firm are not identical.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} What is the distinction between empirical and theoretical economics? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Theoretical economics analyzes individuals and empirical economics analyzes firms.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Theoretical economics analyzes long-term phenomena and empirical economics analyzes short-term.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Theoretical economics builds models, and empirical economics test them.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Theoretical economics tests models, and empirical economics builds them.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Both theoretical and empirical economics can analyze either individuals or firms, and either short-term or long-term phenomena.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 5
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ5" >}} Which of the following statements represents normative, rather than positive analysis? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}People should not be allowed to purchase bodily organs, because it allows the rich access to a life-saving procedure that the poor may not have access to.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Since the supply of gems is limited, their price is very high.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Since the supply of water is very large, the price of water is very low.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The demand for organ transplants currently far exceeds the supply.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}This is a normative statement that is based on an assumption of equity (we want rich and poor to have equal access to treatment.) The others answers are positive statements that are based on facts about the supply and demand of goods in different markets.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
