Individuals make decisions about what to buy and when. But when we talk about the economy every day, we are often analyzing what millions of people are doing and deciding to do at different times. In order to think about this problem, we need to move from the micro to the macro and use our model of individual behavior to generate predictions about what will happen to total demand when the price changes.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

Question 1

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}}What is the definition of the income elasticity of demand? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The percentage change in quantity demanded for a given percentage change in income.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The percentage change in quantity demanded for a given percentage change in price.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The percentage change in quantity demanded for a given percentage change in the price of the other good.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The percentage change in quantity supplied for a given percentage change in income.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}Percentage change in quantity demanded for a given percentage change in price is the price elasticity of demand, and percentage change in quantity demanded for a given percentage change in the price of the other good is a cross-price elasticity.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 2

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}}What is a plausible example of a good with negative income elasticity (i.e., an inferior good?) {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Jewelry.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Rice.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Sports cars.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Steak.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}Rice is a cheap staple food that is generally consumed by poor people; as they become richer, they will consume less rice and consume more of other types of foods. Sports cars, steak and jewelry are all luxury goods, which are generally not inferior goods.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 3

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}}Assume you are consuming two goods, and the price of one increases. However, you are given extra income to ensure that your utility does not decrease. What happens to your consumption of the good with the higher price? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}It decreases.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It increases.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It may increase or decrease.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It stays the same.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}The question describes the substitution effect, and we know that the substitution effect has to be negative: an increase in prices causes you to substitute away from the good whose price is increasing, holding utility constant.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 4

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}}In order to analyze the total effect of a change in price on the total consumption of a good, we decompose it into two components. What are the names of these two components? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The substitution effect and the income effect.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The substitution effect and the inferior effect.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The substitution effect and the normal effect.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}'Normal' and 'inferior' are descriptive terms that can be used to describe whether the income effect is positive or negative, but they are not separate components of an overall price effect.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
