Life would be easy if it was just a question of deciding what we would like most. The answer would probably be more of everything! Of course, economic decisions are not that simple, and the reason is that we are constrained in what we can choose: constrained by the amount of income, the amount of time, or any one of a number of factors. In this lecture we will analyze how consumers make choices when they face a budget constraint.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

Question 1

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}}Which of the following concepts is equivalent to the marginal rate of transformation between two goods? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}All of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The rate at which you can turn one good into the other good in the marketplace.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The ratio of the prices of the two goods.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The slope of the budget constraint.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}These are all equivalent ways to express the concept of the marginal rate of transformation.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 2

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}}What happens to a consumer when the price of a good she consumes increases, or her income decreases? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}She is better off if a good's price increases, but worse off if her income decreases.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}She is unambiguously better off.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}She is unambiguously worse off.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}She may be better off or worse off, depending on her preferences.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}Her opportunity set has been restricted: choices that were available to her before are no longer available to her.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 3

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}}How do we graphically represent the utility maximizing bundle that consumers can afford? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A point on the indifference curve that is to the right of the budget constraint.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The point at which the indifference curve and the budget constraint cross.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The point of tangency between an indifference curve and the budget constraint.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The point where the budget constraint crosses the X or Y axis.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}The point at which the indifference curve and the budget constraint cross is incorrect, because if the indifference curve is crossing the budget constraint the consumer could select another bundle on a higher indifference curve (where she or he obtains more utility) and still be within the budget set. The point where the budget constraint crosses the X or Y axis is incorrect, as this point is not relevant to the consumer's preferences. A point on the indifference curve that is to the right of the budget constraint is incorrect, as a point to the right of the budget constraint is not affordable.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 4

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}}You are consuming two goods, pizzas and movies. At your current bundle, the marginal utility you would gain from spending an extra dollar on pizza is higher than the marginal utility you would gain from spending an extra dollar on movies. What should you do? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Don't change your purchases; you are already consuming the optimal bundle.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It depends on how much income you have.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Purchase more movies.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Purchase more pizza.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}At the optimal consumer bundle, the marginal utility per dollar spent (bang for your buck) should be equal across all goods. If you can obtain more utility from spending an extra dollar on pizza, you should increase your pizza expenditure until the point where the marginal utility per dollar of the two goods is equalized.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Question 5

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ5" >}}What is the definition of a corner solution? {{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}An optimal bundle of two consumer goods in which only one type of good is consumed.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}An optimal bundle of two consumer goods in which the consumer does not spend all of his/her income.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}An optimal bundle of two consumer goods in which the same amount of each good is consumed.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}None of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_solution >}}Graphically, the optimal bundle lies on one of the axes, and thus is referred to as a corner solution. Note that 'an optimal bundle of two consumer goods in which the consumer does not spend all of his/her income' is a case that we rule out in our analysis by assuming that the consumer always spends all of his/her income on consumption, and does not save.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
