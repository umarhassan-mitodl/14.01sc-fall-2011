In 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) into law to address issues of access and cost in healthcare. In this lecture, we discuss these issues in healthcare and the role of the PPACA in addressing these issues to demonstrate how a public policy tool can be used to address many of the economic problems discussed throughout the course.

In turns, it forbids insurance companies from discriminating in health insurance costs. Furthermore, to guarantee that everyone can afford insurance, it provides subsidies for low income individuals.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
