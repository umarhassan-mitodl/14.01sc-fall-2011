A key element of government policy that determines how much we can redistribute among households is the tax rate. The tax rate is used to raise revenues, which can then be used in government programs. What type of taxes we should use and how high tax rates should be are major questions that economics attempts to answer. This lecture provides an introduction to the economics of taxation.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} What is one reason that a consumption tax may be preferable to an income tax? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It can be used to discourage consumption of certain goods.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}It encourages savings, and can be used to discourage consumption of certain goods.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It encourages savings.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It is regressive.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is a consumption tax encourages savings (by making consumption relatively more expensive), and it allows the government to discourage the consumption of certain goods (e.g., cigarettes or alcohol). These may be goods that have negative externalities, or goods that we believe people have difficulty in resisting and thus should be discouraged from eating. A consumption tax is also regressive, but we generally believe that this is a disadvantage, not an advantage, of a consumption tax.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} What is the definition of a targeted government benefit or program? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A benefit or program available to everyone.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}A benefit or program that is only available to those that need it, or those that meet specified criteria.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A benefit or program that is regressive.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}None of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The correct answer is a targeted government benefit or program is only available to those that need the program or households that meet specified criteria. A universal program is available to everyone (the opposite of targeting). A regressive program is one that benefits the rich more than the poor.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
