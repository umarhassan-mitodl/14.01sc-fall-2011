Working with the firm's cost function enables us to learn how much of each input the firm should optimally use to produce a given level of output. However, the firm still has to decide how much output it should produce. This decision depends on the type of market the firm is operating in. We begin by analyzing the most common type of market: perfect competition.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} What is the definition of perfect competition? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}All firms are price takers on both output and input sides.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}All firms have the optimal levels of labor and capital.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}All firms maximize profits.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}There is at least one firm producing the good of interest.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}All firms maximize profits and have optimal levels of labor and capital in perfect competition, but this does not define perfect competition; even firms that are monopolists or oligopolists will maximize profits and set the optimal levels of labor and capital. It is necessary for at least one firm to be producing the good of interest in perfect competition, but not sufficient.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} Consider the market for shoes. If one of the following statements is true, we can conclude that it is not perfectly competitive. Which statement, if true, is evidence against perfect competition? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Demand for a given firm's output is perfectly elastic.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Entry into the shoe market is restricted because a government permit is required.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Supply of a given firm's inputs is perfectly elastic.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}There are low transaction costs in searching for the lowest shoe price.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}If entry and exit into a market is restricted, then this is a violation of perfect competition. The other three answers define perfect competition, rather than being in violation of it.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} In a competitive market, the marginal revenue for selling an additional good is, by definition, equal to what quantity? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}None of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The price of the good being sold.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The price of the primary input.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The wage.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}In a competitive market, every firm is a price-taker, and its decisions about how much to produce do not affect the price. Accordingly, if it sells one more unit, the marginal revenue is the prevailing price.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} A firm should shut down if what condition holds? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Price is below average total cost, but greater than average variable cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Price is below average variable cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Price is greater than average total cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Price is greater than average variable cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}If price is below average total cost, but greater than average variable cost, then the firm has negative profits. However, it is still optimal to continue operating to avoid forgoing the fixed costs already paid.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 5
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ5" >}} What is true about the individual firm demand curve that each firm faces in a competitive market? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It is downward-sloping.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}It is horizontal.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It is upward-sloping.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It is vertical.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The individual firm demand curve in a perfectly competitive market is perfectly elastic, or horizontal. Since the firm is a price-taker, it can sell as many units of the output good as it wants to at that price.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
