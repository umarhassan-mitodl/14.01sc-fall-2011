In this lecture, we continue to learn about competition, and its implications for the supply curve for different goods. We can use this to construct the market supply curve from firms' supply curves. Now we have all the ingredients for fully understanding the basic supply and demand diagrams that launched our study of economics.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} If you compare the elasticity of short-run supply in the markets for two different goods and one market has more firms than the other, which will have a more elastic supply curve? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It depends on the specific production function.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The market with fewer firms.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The market with more firms.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}There is no difference.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The supply curve becomes flatter (more elastic) with more firms in the market, because a given increase in price calls forth more production when there are many firms rather than one.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} In the long run, firms should decide to shut down if what condition holds? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Price is less than average cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Price is less than average fixed cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Price is less than average variable cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Price is less than both average cost and average variable cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}In the long run, all costs are variable, and thus average variable cost and average cost are equivalent. The firm will shut down if price is less than average cost. Average fixed cost is not a relevant concept in the long-run, because all costs are considered to be variable.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} In the long run, what cost measure is minimized? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Average cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Labor supply costs.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Marginal cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Total cost.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}In the long-run, average cost is minimized and the equilibrium is found where price equals minimum average costs.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} In recent years, the American automobile manufacturing industry has struggled; assume that some companies are earning negative profits (i.e., they are losing money). In the long-run, what changes will we expect to see in this market? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A shift toward using more capital than labor.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A shift toward using more labor than capital.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Firm entry.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Firm exit.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}If profits are negative, firms should exit.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 5
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ5" >}} Which of the following is a reason that the long-run supply curve may not be flat and may instead be upward-sloping? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}All of these.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Entry is limited.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Firms are different (i.e., some have lower costs than others).{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Input prices increase with output.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}All of these factors will contribute to a failure of the mechanism by which competition leads to cost minimization in the long-run, and thus will generate an upward-sloping supply curve.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
