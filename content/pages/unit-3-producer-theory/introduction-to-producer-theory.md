As we've already learned, consumers gain utility from buying goods—but every good has to come from somewhere! Goods are produced by firms, and analyzing the decisions of firms is also central to our understanding of the economy. In this lecture, we will learn how companies make important operation decisions.

_When considering firm production decisions, we must consider the two forms of firm input – labor and capital. This image is a work of the US Federal Government and in the public domain. Source: [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/fsac.1a34951/)_.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} What is the primary objective of firms? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Maximizing profit.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Maximizing revenue.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Maximizing utility.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Minimizing costs.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Costs and revenue are relevant to the firm's decision, but their primary objective is maximizing profit. Utility is maximized by consumers, not firms.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} What is the difference between the short-run and the long-run from the perspective of production theory? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}In the short run, all inputs are invariable, and in the long run they are variable.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}In the short run, all inputs are variable, and in the long run they are invariable.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}In the short run, only capital varies, and in the long run both labor and capital vary.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}In the short run, only labor varies, and in the long run both labor and capital vary.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}In the short run, it is easy for a firm to adjust how many employees it has, but it cannot immediately build a new factory or install new equipment. In the long-run, both labor and capital can be changed.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} Which of the following is NOT a property of isoquants? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Always non-linear.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Do not cross.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Downward sloping.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Further out is better.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}Isoquants can be linear when inputs are perfectly substitutable, and thus it is not the case that they are always non-linear.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 4
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ4" >}} What is the term used to describe a production function in which you can double all inputs and output increases by more than double? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Constant returns to scale.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Decreasing returns to scale.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Increasing returns to scale.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Leontief.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution / >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
